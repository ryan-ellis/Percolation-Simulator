# Percolation-Simulator
Java program used to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation. Created as part of Project 1 for the Algorithms Part I course on Coursera.

For example, if sites are opened in a 20-by-20 lattice according to the snapshots below, then our estimate of the percolation threshold is 204/400 = 0.51 because the system percolates when the 204th site is opened.
